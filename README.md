## smabbasht DotFiles
This is a repository I maintain for my personal use, in order to keep track of my dotfiles. It is super useful when I have to setup my tools on a new machine or in case I mess around with my OS (I use Arch btw! XD) and that cute thing takes it serious. <br>
I have curated a neat UI with natural keybindings and aliases, if you guys would want to setup your .config files for the tools mentioned below, you could give these files a try.  

I use:
- Kitty - as my GPU accelerated terminal emulator
- Nvim - as my daily driver, I use it for python, flutter, C/C++, CUDA/OpenCL
- Fish - as my shell

> All config files and folders are for ðŸ‘‘ Linux and I haven't tested them for windows, macOS or other proprietary operating systems so please edit the OS specific sections if you desire to use them
